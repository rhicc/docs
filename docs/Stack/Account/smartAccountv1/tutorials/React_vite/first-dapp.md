- Deploy the smart contract with Remix.
- Use Biconomy Dashboard for getting paymaster URL and bundler URL.
- Register the contract and its write methods on the Biconomy Dashboard.
- Create a frontend with React and Vite that allows for social logins and
  gasless transactions with the Biconomy SDK.
